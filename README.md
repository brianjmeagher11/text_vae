# Text-Generating VAE

A variational autoencoder (VAE) trained to produce synthetic text data. Currently just a Jupyter notebook. 

To run, install UV on your system, then navigate to this directory and run `uv sync` in your terminal. Set the resulting virtual environment as the kernel for the notebook, and you should be good to go!

**Currently under construction!** I am playing with different concepts here to see what works, and make no claim this is a finished product!
